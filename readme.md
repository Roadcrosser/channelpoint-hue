# Twitch Channel Points Philips Hue integration

(I don't have either so I've never tested any of this)

1. Install Python3.7+
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in command prompt (Admin mode) to install dependencies (you only need to do this once)
3. Fill in `config.yaml` (notepad++ recommended) with the required details
4. Run `run.bat` and follow the prompts

**Important note**: This will only work *while* the script is running. You will have to leave it turned on (and remember to turn it on each time) for it to work.
